## Dinha Viagens - Landing Page

This is my first website with **HTML** and **CSS**, which I developed from the design to the code.
It is a very simple website, because it's my first one.

- One of the major challenges that I faced during the development of this website was making it **responsive**!
- And one of the functionalities that I couldn't implement was the **hamburger menu** for the mobile version!
- On the other hand, I learned how to add animations to some elements and use flexbox.

Check the website clicking [here](https://dinhaviagens.com.br/)!

### To-do:
- [ ] Other simple projects to improve my HTML and CSS skills.
- [ ] Learn JavaScript and add it to this website, to make it interactive/functional.
- [ ] Add a hamburger button/menu to the mobile version.
