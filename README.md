## Dinha Viagens - Landing Page

This is my first website with **HTML** and **CSS**, wich I developed from the design to the code.
It is a very simple website, cause it's my first one.

🟡 One of the major challenges that I faced during the development of this website was making it **responsive**!
✅ 
❌ And one of the funcionalities that I couldn't implement was the **hamburguer menu** for mobile version!

Check the website clicking [here](https://dinhaviagens.com.br/)!

### To-do:
- [ ] Other simple projects to improve my knowledge in HTML and CSS.
- [ ] Learn JavaScript and add it to this website to make it interactive/functional
- [ ] Add a hamburguer button/menu to the mobile version.

📩 If you have any notes or suggestions about it, please contact me, I'll apreciate to hear you!
